Repository containing my dotfiles for my i3 setup, and my conky set up when I am using Plasma. 

For polybar, you need Nerd fonts and Font awesome.

The spotify status in the bottom bar uses python scripts from this repository: https://github.com/dietervanhoof/polybar-spotify-controls, so you will need to configure that for the spotify stuff to work.

Wallpaper I found is in the backgrounds folder.
